ion
===

a frontend framework with mettle.

What started off as a proof of concept became a new way to realize how it all comes together.
special thanks to tbranyen and all the contributors to Backbone.LayoutManager for making it one step closer to possible.

ion is meant as a counterpart for Lattice - a php framework i am developing.  in tandem the two will open up new levels of interactive design, but the two also work 100% independent of one another.  
tandem makes use of jQuery( of course ),RequireJS, Mettle( Backbone+ ), & LoDash.  
ion strives to do 2 things, and do them well - manage a set of views and transition between them.  care was taken as to allow the same level of freedom in ion as in Backbone, to structure your code how you see fit.
